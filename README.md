# Cloud Infrastructure Projects

Installed CLI (Project 1)- Launched Amazon EC2 instance using the AWS CLI. Troubleshooted AWS CLI commands and Amazon EC2 service setting. 

AWS Systems Manager (Project 2)- Implemented AWS Systems Manager inventory to verify configurations and permissions. Implemented AWS Systems Manager Run Command to run tasks on multiple servers. Explored the AWS Systems Manager Parameter store feature to update application settings or configurations. Lastly, the AWS Systems Manager session was implemented to access the command line on an instance. 

Creating EC2 instance (Project 3)- Launched an Amazon EC2 instance using the management console and the AWS CLI.

Using an AutoScaling Group (Project 4)- Created a new AMI by using the AWS CLI. Used EC2 Auto Scaling to scale up the number of servers available for a specific task when other servers were experiencing heavy load. 

Working with Lambda (Project 5)- Recognised necessary IAM policy permissions to enable lambda function to other AWS resources. Created a lambda layer to satisfy an external library dependency. Deployed and tested a Lambda function that is triggered based on a schedule that invokes another function. Used CloudWatch logs to troubleshoot any issues when running a lambda  function. 

Migrate to RDS (Project 6)- Created an RDS MariaDB instance using AWS CLI. Migrated data from a local MariaDB database to an Amazon RDS MariaDB database. Monitored an Amazon RDS instance using Amazon CloudWatch Metrics. 

Configuring an VPC (Project 7)- Created a VPC that contained a private and public subnet, IGW, and NAT. Configured Route Tables associated with a public subnet for internet-bound traffic to be directed to the IGW for direct internet access. Configured Route Tables associated with a private subnet for isolated resources to securely connect to the internet through a NAT Gateway. Launched a Bastion Host in a public subnet for resource-based secured access to the private subnet. Evaluated the operation of the private subnetâ€™s ability to communicate with the internet. 

Managing Storage (Project 8)- Created and maintained snapshots for Amazon EC2 instances. Uploaded files to and downloaded files from Amazon S3. 

Monitoring Infrastructure (Project 9)- Used AWS Systems Manager Run Command to install the CloudWatch Agent on Amazon EC2 instances. Monitored the Application Logs using CloudWatch Agent and CloudWatch Logs. Created real-time notifications using CloudWatch Events. Tracked infrastructure compliance using AWS config. 

Managed Resources with Tagging (Project 10)- Applied tags to existing AWS resources. Found resources based on tags. Used the AWS CLI or AWS SDK for PHP to stop and terminate Amazon EC2 instances based on certain attributes of the resource. 

Automating Deployments with AWS CloudFormation (Project 11)- Deployed AWS CloudFormation stack with a defined VPC and a Security Group. Configured an AWS CloudFormation stack with resources, such as an Amazon S3 bucket and Amazon EC2. Terminated the AWS CloudFormation and its respective resources.
